## Overview

This game is created with javaScript and jQuery. The player is shown a question from an array of objects and has a set amount of time to select an answer. After the player selects their answer then the app will display if their answer was correct or incorrect and a gif will be played until the next question object in the array is displayed. When all of the questions are displayed the final score will be displayed and the player will have the option to restart the game.
